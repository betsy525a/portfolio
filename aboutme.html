            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Betsabe Bajana and this is my digital portfolio.
                Right now it is under construction but feel free to look 
                around.

            <h3>Coding Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I am a high school student in New York City.
                So far I am learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript through 
                ScriptEd.
                I have also learned the fundamentals of Python through the
                Bloomberg Startup Coding Camp.
                In high school I took a Computer Science Principles class and
                got a 5 on my AP exam.
                I am trying to learn as many coding languages as possible.
            </p>
